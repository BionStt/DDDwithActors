# DDDwithActors
Note that at the time this workshop was given at DDD Europe 2017, Akka.NET did not fully support the Akka Persistence specification/implementation. Thus, I didn't provide the Account.cs sample as extending PersistentActor. You can look at the Scala example to see how this might work once supported.
